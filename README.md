# Open Bionic Arm
by Seweryn Malczewski

## Description
Open source project of automated bionic arm, created by me. It contains schematics of muscle activity detectors, motherboards with controllers, 3D models (and) designs of arm/hand construction and the software.

## Objectives of the project
Create a construction of the arm(with hand), needed electronic like the muscle sensors, controller and software that will be able to properly control the mechanism depending on the signals received from the muscles.
